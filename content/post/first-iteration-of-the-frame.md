[Our first design](http://furbuild.com/post/elastic-band-head-frame/) didn't work out too well.
As we attached foam to the frame. it would stretch the elastic bands until a point where it wasn't snug enough to support all that weight.
Top of the frame wasn't solid enough to support large ears which would also become a problem.

We were able to go with an ad-hoc solution and extend the existing frame with two thicker elastic bands going over the top of the head.
Once attached, everything sat snugly, resting on top of the head and as a result the jaw got more animated as it was more closely connected.

I took these learnings and preemptively improved the head frame that had not yet been foamed.
It's pretty much same as the ad-hoc solution but much better fitted.

We decided that there's no point in being able to open up the head in the back.
Once the foam goes on the elastic bands it's extremely easy to just pull it over your head.

#### Conclusion
It's much more comfortable than it was before since it distributes the weight on all of your head and not just around it.
I'm also very happy with how light yet sturdy it is.
