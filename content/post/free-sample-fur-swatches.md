I found a site called [_fabric-online_](https://www.fabric-online.co.uk/faux-fur-fabric?cat=17072) who provide up to four sample fur swatches.
We only payed the shipping cost of **Â£4.80** from the UK to Sweden.

Here are the samples we ordered and what we want to use respective type for:

#### Ivory shorthaired
Intended for [Cara's](/character/caraid) muzzle, chin, throat and stomach.

#### London cream
Intended for [Cara's](/character/caraid) chest and ears.
