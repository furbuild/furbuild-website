Today I ordered foam from a _foam specialist_ here in Sweden called [Skumplastspecialisten](http://www.skumplastspecialisten.se/index.asp).
They will conveniently deliver the foam to a bed store next to my workplace.

Since I have no idea how much foam will be used, I have no idea if this is a generous or conservative order for two suit heads.
Considering the heads will be quite small, I assume we can be quite economical with the amount of foam.
I ended up ordering three pieces of foam, exaggerating slightly for my estimates.

- **`50 * 50 * 5 cm`** — Medium hard
- **`50 * 100 * 3 cm`** — Medium hard
- **`50 * 50 * 2 cm`** — Very hard

#### Options in quality
We had a variety in options of what foam to get, ranging in thickness, hardness and cell structure.
All the foam we ended up ordering was normal polyester foam.

#### Costliness of specialist foam
The total price for the foam ended up on **700 SEK (82.65 USD)** which was somewhat expected if we wanted specific types of foam.
I think the only cheaper option would have been to buy a foam mattress, but we decided against it.
We're not paying any shipping cost since they're constantly shipping large batches to the bed store.

#### Inspiration
There is an abundance of resources on the interwebs for making fursuit heads with foam.
For most people, I think [Matrices has the best rundown of the basics](http://www.matrices.net/foam.asp).

Then I've also found a very useful time-lapse of someone sculpting their head with foam. {{< youtube eRHyYimr3GI >}}
