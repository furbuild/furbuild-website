#### To the Drawing Board

Before we could begin with plotting out the foam to carve the prototype fursuit head, we needed a reference to work from. Since we did not have our own mannequin heads yet, I looked up images of head bases in Google and found a [convenient turnaround](http://imageshack.com/a/img921/6421/vlEqyL.jpg) which I loaded in Photoshop and laid out in such a way that I could easily sketch over it. 

Since I am more familiar with my own character I started with her. Initially, we wanted to go for a more [realistic approach](http://imageshack.com/a/img922/43/SOX8li.jpg) but weren't happy with the way it looked. So instead, we went for slightly more [stylized](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img923/2202/oBAZjN.jpg) heads, with larger eyes, a more expressive face and slightly exaggerated proportions. After having sketched out my own character, it was easy enough to translate the features and proportions onto [Zee's](http://imageshack.com/a/img924/6811/6EA5Ww.jpg) head. 

While not relevant yet, I was curious to see what our characters would look like [in color](http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img921/7446/sunEhC.jpg) so I roughed in their colorations after having finished the sketches.

#### Getting the measurements

Obviously, the digital head I had in Photoshop and our mannequins were not of the same size, so to translate my sketches into real life measurements we had to calculate the ratio between the virtual head and the real one. We did this by measuring the width of our mannequins at the widest part of the head, then measuring the width of the digital mannequin (Photoshop has a ruler tool which you can use for this). While the exact measurements are not particularly relevant for this article, we found out that the digital head was 10cm wide, and the real one 19cm. This meant that the ratio for all of the measurements was 1,9:1. So, all we had to do now was get the measurements of the sketch, multiply them by 1.9 and we would have the real life measurements.  

#### Cutting out the foam

At this point things got a bit experimental. Having no prior experience in building fursuit heads, and wanting to do things our own way meant that our best bet was to take a trial-and-error approach with a lot of margin. So I plotted out the rough foam shape that I thought I would need and added a cm or two on all sides to make sure that I would have enough to work with. I figured it would be easier to cut away excess foam than to add more. The images below show the plotting out of the rough shape and what it translated to in real life.

After having cut out the rough foam shape and glued it onto the elastic straps, I could start the sculpting of the lower jaw. This was an entirely new experience for me, using simple box cutters to chip away at the foam until it had the desired shape. It took a bit of time getting used to, but after half an hour or so I got more and more confident, cutting away larger chunks and being fairly happy with the direction it was going.

We applied the same method for the muzzle, though this time I did not strictly follow the sketch I made and instead relied on my knowledge of the feline head structure to sculpt more intuitively. I used a sharpie to draw directly onto the foam cutout and so created guidelines for myself to cut around. I then copied these guidelines over to the other side of the face to try and maintain some symmetry - this didn't always turn out quite as planned, and for future reference I would not remove the head from the mannequin during the carving process to ensure that everything remains aligned.

For the top of the head and the nose bridge, we did not refer to the sketch at all but simply cut out a rectengular shape, covering all of the top of the head and muzzle so that I could carve out the head shape that I wanted. For this we had to remove the initial "helmet" we had, which was not quite big enough. I drew a center line over the top of the head and sketched out the rough structure of the top of the muzzle to make sure everything would be aligned and in proportion.

From here on everything was done "wing it"-style. For the eyebrows I simply cut out shapes I thought I needed, glued it on top of the base and carved out the shapes I wanted.

For the ears I took a slightly more elaborate approach - sadly I forgot to take pictures of the process, but I'll try to summarize what I did. I cut a basic ear shape out of paper, curved it around and pinned it onto the head in the rough position I wanted them to be in. I then cut away at the base and the shape of the paper until I was satisfied with the way it sat on the head and how it looked (roughly) from the front, side and back, bearing in mind that I could add thickness with the foam. I then took the resulting paper cutout, traced it out on the thinnest foam we have and used that as the base shape of the ear. Since ears are rounded at the base I wanted to add some thickness, so I cut out a piece of thicker foam to cover most of the ear shape and glued it on top of the thinner foam so I could carve away at it later.

So, what I had now was an ear-shaped block of foam that I simply sculpted into the ear shape I wanted - using references of lionesses and other big cats as a guideline for the form. Occasionally I would press it onto the head to see how it would sit and ensure that I would have space and surface to glue the two together. Once I had one ear finished I repeated the process for the other, pinned them both onto the head and drew an outline around them to make sure that I would glue them in the right place. Once glued on we noticed that they did not align perfectly, but it was easy enough to make some adjustments to fix the symmetry.
