bio = "I have been an enthusiastic hobbyist for many years prior to starting my artistic career. I enjoys a large variety of games, music, films and books which, occasionally combined with a glass of red wine or cup of coffee, are the fuel for my imagination. I graduated for my BA in Game Art at the USAT in 2014 and I now work freelance as an illustrator and concept artist."
